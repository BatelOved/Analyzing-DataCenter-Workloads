# 1. Introduction

Analyzing data-center workloads is a crucial task in understanding the performance and efficiency of modern computing infrastructures. Over the years, data-center architectures have evolved from the classical Von Neumann and Turing models to embrace new technologies that push the boundaries of computational capabilities. The relentless progression of Mooreâ€™s Law has been a driving force, enabling the continuous advancement of processing power and the development of future architectures such as quantum computing, artificial intelligence (AI), and graphics processing units (GPUs). However, central processing units (CPUs) are significantly impacted by the *memory wall*, which represents a bottleneck in data transfer between computational and memory components. Additionally, the deceleration of Moore's Law compels us to explore inventive methods for enhancing performance.

The increasing popularity of cloud computing has introduced a new dimension to data-center workloads, with multiple cloud providers offering scalable and flexible resources for a wide range of applications. Furthermore, the landscape of data-center hardware has diversified with the emergence of different processor architectures, including those from Intel, ARM, AMD and more. To assess the effectiveness of these architectures and their associated workloads, various performance metrics and benchmarks are employed.

In this work, we delve into the analysis of data-center workloads, examining the current architectures, exploring performance metrics and benchmarks, and considering the impact of cloud providers on data-center operations.
