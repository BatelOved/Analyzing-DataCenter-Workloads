# 1. Introduction

The increasing popularity of cloud computing has introduced a new dimension to data-center workloads, with multiple cloud providers offering scalable and flexible resources for a wide range of applications. Furthermore, the landscape of data-center hardware has diversified with the emergence of different processor architectures, including those from Intel, ARM, AMD and more. To assess the effectiveness of these architectures and their associated workloads, various performance metrics and benchmarks are employed.

In this work, we delve into the analysis of data-center workloads, examining the current architectures, exploring performance metrics and benchmarks, and considering the impact of cloud providers on data-center operations.
